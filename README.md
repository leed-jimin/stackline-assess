# StackLine assessment

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To run

In the project directory, run(in order):

### `npm run api`

Runs the mock db where we can fetch data

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Enhancements(that I would've added)

- Mobile Responsiveness
- SVG file was wrong so I had to make adjustments
